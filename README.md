CV Screener - Currently I am using a single cv as input. Trying to parse the data from the cv using the ocr. Once that is done the data is then parsed to llm to fetch the data which includes personal information, education, experience, skills, certification and project. Once the information gets extracted then it's then saved as a json file. Then as the last step I created a chatbot interface using gradio to query the data fetched from that particular cv.
