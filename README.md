CV Screener - It's a base version of a project where we are fetching the core information from the cv which is in a pdf format and then querying on the information which is being fetched by the help of llm. Currently I am using a single cv as input. Trying to parse the data from the cv using the ocr by using the help of pytesseract. Once that is done the data is then parsed to llm to fetch the required data which includes personal information, education, experience, skills, certification and project. Once the information gets extracted then it's saved into a json file. Then as the last step I created a chatbot interface using gradio to query the data fetched from that particular cv.
